# TotemStorage
 
Minecraft Bukkit/Spigot Plugin, that let's players store totems of undying in a vault (config file). I added an extra cost of diamonds (configurable amount) to store a totem. Storing a totem is done by sending the command /storetotem. <br />
Totems will be used automatically if the player would die, just like they would have it in their main or off hand.
